I am making this mod in my **free time**, so if you want to help me, [**pay me a drink**](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZZ2T95G9H72YE).

## What you NEED to know

To **configurate** the mod hit `P` key (can be changed) or execute `/cpsdisplay`

The mod offers a high level of **customization** and is **automatically updated**

![Update manager settings](https://cpsdisplay.github.io/assets/images/mod/update_manager_settings.png)

The mod features a built-in **color selector** for easy choice of the **ideal** color in the style of minecraft, but you can use resource packs for change its appearence.

## More about all the settings

### Move
To move the text you simply need to hold click on the text and drag our mouse where you want.

![Text In Settings](https://cpsdisplay.github.io/assets/images/mod/text_in_settings.png)

The GUI background is cut out around the text, so you can see what the text will look like during play.

### Text shadow

You can enable or disable it

### Text scale

From `10%` to `400%`

### Text color

Click on the button to open the color selector and select the color you want (no opacity available, minecraft limitation). 

### Text mode

There are 4 different modes:
- Left
- Right
- Left & Right
- Custom

The first 3 modes have a default text, but can be redefined in the mod's lang files using resource packs.

### Custom text

You have 999 characters available. `{0}` will be replaced by left clicks, `{1}` by right clicks.

You can use minecraft formatting (instead of `§` use `&`) and do things like this

![Custom Text Example](https://cpsdisplay.github.io/assets/images/mod/custom_text_example.png)

### Rainbow

I usually call this the "epileptic mode" - the text color changes over time. Custom color is therefore not available, but you can use minecraft formatting as a workaround.

### Background color

Same as [text color](#text-color), but this time alpha channel is available.

### Background margin

How big is the background. Min: `0`; Max: `99`

## And that's it

There is nothing more, but if you want more, you have **2** solutions:
- Join the discord server and create a new post about the idea you have in the suggestion channel
- If you have programming skills, feel free to fork the github project to add what you want and create a pull request for everyone to enjoy


Thanks
