# Introduction

I use minecraft forge for playing minecraft, but i wanted to see what my right and left cps are, i searched for a good mod for minecraft 1.8, but i didn't found anything good. I only found 2 mods, one display only left clicks, and the other is too little for me and can't be zoomed... So as i'm a programmer, i decided to code a mod for myself, but i never really use java so sorry if the mod have problems, i'm just here for training and have a mod which respond my requirements.

And sorry for my bad english, i'm french ahah

# License

Do what you want with this mod, it's under MIT license, fork it, use it into a modpack, use it for your minecraft client, sell it without any modification (that's a joke, you aren't allowed to sell mods), i don't care about it, i just do this mod for me because i don't found any mod i want like this and because i like programing in my free time
